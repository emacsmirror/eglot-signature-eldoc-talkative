#+TITLE: ~eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative~

* Rationale

Eglot does not instruct ElDoc to echo the field "documentation" of
LSP-objects "signature information" and "parameter information" (into
the echo-area). To read those fields, the user instead has to open the
=*eldoc*= buffer by calling the command ~eldoc-doc-buffer~ (bound to
=C-h .= by default).

This package offers a function, ~eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative~,
that makes Eglot instruct ElDoc to echo the field "documentation" of
LSP-objects "signature information" and "parameter information" (into
the echo-area).

This packages only makes sense to use when you use ElDoc version
1.14.0 (released on 2nd April 2023) or later because that's when the
=:echo= key was introduced.

See also [[* Screenshots][section "Screenshots"]] which includes an explanation.

* Usage

For installation, clone the repository to a path where it can stay
permanently, and in your Emacs' =init.el=, add that path to your
~load-path~ variable.

For usage, in Eglot-managed buffers, in the buffer-local variable
~eldoc-documentation-functions~, replace
~eglot-signature-eldoc-function~ with
~'eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative~. For example, like this:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun my-eglot-specific-eldoc ()

  ;; use custom doc-funcs with custom priorities (by order)
  (setq-local eldoc-documentation-functions
    (list
      #'eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative
      #'eglot-hover-eldoc-function
      #'flymake-eldoc-function))

  ;; optionally, in echo-area, only show the most important
  ;; documentation
  ;; (setq-local eldoc-documentation-strategy
  ;; #'eldoc-documentation-enthusiast)
  )

(add-hook 'eglot-managed-mode-hook #'my-eglot-specific-eldoc)
#+end_src

* Screenshots

[[https://codeberg.org/mekeor/emacs-eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative/raw/branch/screenshots/default.png][Here]]'s a screenshot with the default Eglot behavior, i.e. where
~eglot-signature-eldoc-function~ is in usage:

[[https://codeberg.org/mekeor/emacs-eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative/raw/branch/screenshots/talkative.png][Here]]'s a screenshot which uses the function
~eglot-signature-eldoc-talkative~ provided by this Emacs package, as
instructed in the [[* Usage][section "Usage"]]:

In this example, this package lead to Eglot letting ElDoc show two
additional things:

1. The documentation of the active parameter (parameter information).
2. The documentation of the function (signature information).

(Note that the "(parameter) error: Fastify.FastifyError [â€¦]" bit is
only gone because I opted into setting ~eldoc-documentation-strategy~
to ~eldoc-documentation-enthusiast~ for the screenshot. If you prefer
to keep it, don't use the strategy "enthusiast".)

* Why not contribute upstream?

I [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2023-04/msg00613.html][asked]] the maintainer of Eglot "Would you be fine with me creating
another bug report / feature request, aiming to make it configurable,
whether docs should be shown in the echo-area?" and he [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2023-04/msg00618.html][replied]] with
"IMO there's already plenty of configuration knobs for what gets shown
where, so don't expect much enthusiasm from me personally". That's why
I decided to provide this feature as a separate package instead.
